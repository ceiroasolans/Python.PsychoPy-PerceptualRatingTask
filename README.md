# Perceptual Rating Task

The code in this repository allows participants to rate the extent to which they taste propylthiouracil (PROP), a chemical that tastes extremelly bitter to people who have a mutation in the bitter-taste-receptor gene TAS2R38. This task was used in a study testing people's ability to display empathic behavior when they cannot experience the event which is causing another person's distress.
